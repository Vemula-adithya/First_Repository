      "The purpose of this study is to  learn whether an investigational automated insulin delivery \n",
      "system (“study system”) for individuals with type 1 diabetes  can safely improve blood glucose \n",
      "(sometimes called blood sugar) control. The system uses continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), an insulin pump, and a software algorithm to automatically give insulin and control blood glucose.  Is also sometimes called a “closed -loop” system.  \n",
      " The CGM sensor has a thin needle that is inserted just under the skin.  It measures the glucose in the fluid under the skin and shows this information on the insulin pump every 5 minutes.  The sensor needs to be changed about every 10 days. The insulin pump has a catheter that is inserted under the skin.  It needs to be changed about every 3 days.   The overall study system is made by a company called Tandem Diabetes Care and is called t:slim X2 with Control-IQ. The CGM and insulin pump part of the system are similar to devices that are currently available for people to purchase and use. The software algorithm runs on the pump and calculates how much insulin you r child  will automatically receive. This algorithm has \n",
      "been tested in previous studies using different CGMs, insulin pumps, and computer components. These studies did not find increased risk for high or low blood glucose or other problems.  The study system is experimental and can only be used for research. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its use in this research study. Tandem Diabetes Care plans to use the results of thi s study to get FDA approval to sell the study system in the U.S.  \n",
